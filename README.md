# Embedded Journey – Firmware Sprint Series

Welcome to my embedded systems learning repository!  
This project documents a sprint-based approach to mastering embedded firmware development on STM32 and ESP32 platforms.

---

## Overview

The aim of this repository is to build a strong foundation in embedded C programming, real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS), hardware interfacing, communication protocols, and production-ready firmware techniques. Each sprint introduces focused topics and hands-on projects, progressively advancing complexity and system integration.

---

## Platforms & Tools

- Microcontrollers: STM32 Nucleo-F411RE, ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1  
- Development Environments: STM32CubeIDE, PlatformIO, VS Code  
- Frameworks & Libraries: STM32 HAL, FreeRTOS  
- Debug & Analysis: Segger SystemView, UART, Logic Analyzer  

---

## Learning Goals

- Gain proficiency in embedded C and Python for embedded systems  
- Develop production-level firmware with robust error handling and power management  
- Implement communication protocols: UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, MQTT  
- Build OTA update and bootloader systems for field firmware upgrades  
- Document projects with professional README files, technical PDFs, and demonstration videos
